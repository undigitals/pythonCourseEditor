Lambda function is a function without name or can be created without `def` keyword. Hence,
it's called anonymous function and all anonymous functions are called `lambda`. What? lol.

This function can take any number of arguments but can have only one expression.

Example:

```python
x = lambda a : a*10
print(x(10)) # 100
```

Lambda function always has to start with the`lambda` keyword and next to the keyword function
argument which `a` in above example.

Compare with python function:

```python
def x (a):
  return a*10

print(x(10)) # 100
```

```python
class Person():
  eyes = 2
  ears = 2
  nose = 1

print(dir(Person))
```
