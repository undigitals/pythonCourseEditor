title: "List Methods"

There are number of built-in list methods for python which are useful in number of occasions.

# len()

One of the most useful one is `len()` method, returns `int` for number of elements inside the list.

```python
fruits=["banana", "mango", "apple", "berry", "cocos"]
print(len(fruits)) #5
```

Why it is useful?

In the case of `fruits`, `len()` might be not that much useful, because you can count the elements inside `fruits` list.
However, what if there are 167 elements inside the `list` or 1000, it would take some time to count them, right?
So then `len()` will be your savior.

Let's do one example task:

```python
bunchofnumbers = [1,1,1,10,10]
```

Compute the avarage integer.

Try not to look at the solution below.

```python
bunchofnumbers = [1,1,1,10,10]
av = 0
for i in bunchofnumbers:
  av+=i
print(av/5) # 4.6
```

So 4.6 is an avarage value. But what if `bunchofnumbers = [1,1,1,10,10,12,13,8]` we have 8 elements inside the `list`
the we need to change `print(av/8)`. Again, what if elements are uncountable, still we need to count? what ðŸ˜„?.

```python
bunchofnumbers = [1,1,1,10,10]
av = 0
length = len(bunchofnumbers)
for i in bunchofnumbers:
  av+=i
print(av/length) # 4.6
```

That's it!!!

Now we don't have to change anything, even if the `list` is uncountable. `len()` will get us the length of the `list`.
