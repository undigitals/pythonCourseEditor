# Arithmetic Operators

In python there are 6 major Arithmetic operators. The first 4 are same is math
like `addition`, `subtraction`, `multiplication`, and `division`.

Example:

```python
#Addition
print(3+3)

#Subtraction
print(3-3)

#Multiplication
print(3*3)

#Division
print(3:3)
```

Except those 4 basic operators python has 3 additional arithmetic operators.

`%` -> `Modulus`, one of the important operators which helps with finding remainder.
`7%3` from this equation we will get `1`
