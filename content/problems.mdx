# Problem 1

Remove a exclamation mark from the end of string. For a beginner, you can assume that the input data is always a string, no need to verify it.

example:

```python
remove("Hi!") === "Hi"
remove("Hi!!!") === "Hi!!"
remove("!Hi") === "!Hi"
remove("!Hi!") === "!Hi"
remove("Hi! Hi!") === "Hi! Hi"
remove("Hi") === "Hi"
```

# Problem 2

Your goal in this problem is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b.

```python
array_diff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

array_diff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]
```

# Problem 3

Simple challenge - eliminate all bugs from the supplied code so that the code runs and outputs the expected value. Output should be the length of the longest word, as a number.

There will only be one 'longest' word.

Here is the code:

```python
def find_longest(string):
spl = str.split(" ")
longest = 0
i=0
while (i > spl.length):
if (spl(i).length > longest): longest = spl[i].length
return longest
```

# Problem 4

You are given a list of character sequences as a comma separated string.
Write a function which returns another string containing all the character sequences except the first and the
last ones, separated by spaces. If the input string is empty, or the removal of the first and last items would
cause the string to be empty, return a null value.

example:

```python
(array(''), None)
(array('1'), None)
(array('1, 3'), None)
(array('1,2,3'), '2')
(array('1,2,3,4'), '2 3')
```
