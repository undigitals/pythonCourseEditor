# Problem 1

Remove a exclamation mark from the end of string. For a beginner kata, you can assume that the input data is always a string, no need to verify it.

example:

```python
remove("Hi!") === "Hi"
remove("Hi!!!") === "Hi!!"
remove("!Hi") === "!Hi"
remove("!Hi!") === "!Hi"
remove("Hi! Hi!") === "Hi! Hi"
remove("Hi") === "Hi"
```

# Problem 2

Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b.

```python
array_diff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

array_diff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]
```
